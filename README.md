# Nav Bar Hover Effect

🎨 This repository contains code for a simple web page with a navigation bar hover effect. When you hover over each navigation item, it dynamically loads content from a URL and displays it on the page. The code is written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser.

## How it Works
- 🖱️ The HTML structure defines a header with a navigation bar and an empty content div.
- ⚙️ JavaScript is used to listen for mouseover events on each navigation link.
- 🌐 When a link is hovered over, it fetches content from the URL specified in the link's href attribute.
- 🖼️ The fetched content is then dynamically inserted into the content div.
